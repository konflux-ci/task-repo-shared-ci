    Dummy task whose purpose is to:

    1. Make it easier to test the behavior of the scripts and workflows in this repo
    2. Provide an example of the repo layout that the workflows expect to operate on
    3. This 0.2 version also provides an example of a task migration by adding a required 'pipelinerun-name' param.
  params:
    # no default value, the param is required.
    # therefore it requires pipeline migration
    - name: pipelinerun-name
      type: string
